Mobile Troubleshooting System Chatbot
In this program I created a program which asks users a variety of questions in regards to their device to find out what is wrong with it and then gives them a simple solution or advice to go to a repair centre
If the repair can be done in store - then they are asked for more personal details and then asssigned a caseID
